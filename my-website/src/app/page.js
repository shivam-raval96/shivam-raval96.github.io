          I'm a research scientist focusing on making machine learning more
          interpretable through visualization and interactive systems. My work
          combines techniques from deep learning, human-computer interaction,
          and information visualization.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Research Philosophy</h2>I
        believe in creating tools and visualizations that help people understand
        complex systems. My research aims to bridge the gap between powerful ML
        models and human understanding.
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Impact</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By emphasizing visual, interactive explanations of AI techniques, we
          aim to make complex AI systems more accessible, transparent, and
          trustworthy for all stakeholders, from researchers and developers to
          end-users and policymakers.
